Changes from Hy 0.9.4

  [ Syntax Fixes ]

    * Added "not" as the inline "not" operator. It's advised to still
      use "not-in" or "is-not" rather then nesting. (JD)

    * Added "~" as the "invert" operator. (JD)

    * `catch' now accepts a new format: (JD)
        (catch [] BODY)
        (catch [Exception] BODY)
        (catch [e Exception] BODY)
        (catch [e [Exception1 Exception2]] BODY)

    * `let' macro added (PT)

  [ Language Changes ]

    * UTF encoded symbols are allowed, but mangled. All Hy source is now
      presumed to be UTF-8. (JD + PT)

    * Better builtin signature checking  (JD)

    * If hoisting (for things like printing the return of an if statement)
      have been added. '(print (if true true true))'
