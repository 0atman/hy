Code contributors:

 - Paul R. Tagliamonte <tag@pault.ag>

I'd also like to thank the following people:

 - Kragen Sitaker:
    Major thanks goes to Kragen on helping me work through some of the
    namespacing crap. I think the majority of the approach taken now
    with expressions' eval bits is his doing in one way or another.
